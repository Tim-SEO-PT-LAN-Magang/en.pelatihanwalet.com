The timing for harvesting is crucial as it affects the quality of the produced nests and the yield obtained. There are several factors to consider in determining the right harvesting time, including room temperature, weather conditions, nest conditions, and the number of birds being raised.<\/p>\n<p>According to successful swiftlet breeders, the best time for harvesting is in the morning around 5 to 8 a.m. At that time, the air temperature is still cool, and the nest conditions are not too dry. In addition, swiftlet birds have flown out to search for food in the morning, so they do not disturb the harvesting process. However, each breeder has different experiences in determining the right harvesting time according to their environmental and coop conditions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Best Time for Harvesting Edible Birdnests<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Harvesting edible birdnests should be done at the right time to ensure maximum quality and quantity of the yield. Some experts suggest that harvesting should be done in the morning or late afternoon when swiftlet birds are still active and routinely entering and exiting the grotto. In addition, weather conditions also need to be considered. Do not harvest during bad weather such as rain or strong winds, as it can disturb the environmental balance in the grotto and affect the quality of the produced nests.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Age of Swiftlet Birds and Their Life Cycle<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Knowing the age of swiftlet birds is important in running a swiftlet business. Swiftlet birds usually reach peak productivity at the age of 3 to 4 years. After reaching that age, the production of edible birdnests will start to decline. Therefore, adding the swiftlet bird population is necessary to maintain the productivity of the produced nests.<\/p>\n<p>The life cycle of swiftlet birds is divided into several phases, namely development, reproduction, growth, and rest phases. Each phase has different nutritional needs. Therefore, swiftlet business owners need to understand the life cycle phases of swiftlet birds to provide the right feed and nutrition according to the needs of the birds in each phase.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Export Market for Edible Birdnests<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Edible birdnests are an export product with high demand in the international market, especially in East Asia such as China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. In addition, countries such as the United States, Europe, and Australia are also potential markets for edible birdnest products. Business operators can sell edible birdnests directly abroad or through intermediaries or export agents. However, before starting exports, it is necessary to understand the regulations and export requirements in the destination country and conduct quality checks and required production standards.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After learning about the swiftlet industry, we can conclude that swiftlet business can be a profitable opportunity with affordable capital. However, to achieve optimal results, several important factors need to be considered, such as the right harvesting time, good swiftlet bird maintenance, and the selection of the correct edible birdnest processing method.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, we also need to pay attention to regulations and halal certification to ensure that the produced edible birdnests are acceptable in the global market and meet the needs of consumers who are increasingly aware of the quality of halal and safe products.<\/p>\n<p>To further explore the swiftlet industry, there is a Training Walet platform that can provide training and guidance on swiftlet bird maintenance, edible birdnest processing, and comprehensive swiftlet business development. By obtaining deeper knowledge about the swiftlet industry, we can increase the chance of success in running a promising business in this industry.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Running a business in the swiftlet industry requires serious attention, especially in determining the right time for harvesting.
